# Basic_C-Sharp

These are some projects I have made using C#. 

PROJECTS:

  Car Insurance
  
  This projects is a MVC web application that acts like a car insurance website. It takes numerous of user's input 
  on basic policy information, then calculates a quote based on the information given. Then there is also a Admin 
  page in which is allows STAFF to view all of the quotes that have been issued. 

  Casino 
  
  The game Blackjack is a program I put together in C#. In this game, the player/ the user is playing against
  the dealer with the goal of getting a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over it. There was 
  many features that needed to be added to this game but overall it is the same game as if you were really at a 
  casino!

  LAMBDA
  
  The application LAMDA was created in C# and I was able to use LAMBDA expressions to perform filtering and selection operations
  on list of employees.


  Parsing_Enums
  
  This console application is a simple program that prompts the user to enter the current day of the week and assigns the value to a          variable of an enum data type representing the days of the week. It also includes error handling using a try/catch block to handle          incorrect input.

  Student Database
  
  This console application demonstrates how to create a basic Entity Framework Code-First console application that creates a Student          database and adds one student.
